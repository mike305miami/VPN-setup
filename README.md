In order to make the VPN work, you have to check your current IP adress by going to whatismyipaddress.com save it on your notepad to know for sure when you do have the VPN downloaded it shows a different IP address compared to the one assigned to you from your actual PC.

Once successfully Downloaded the VPN will connect you automatically to a server in a different part of the world and you'll have a different IP address assigned compared to the one your normal Pc uses. What you finally want to do is go back to whatismyipaddress.com and make sure you have your VPN's IP address set compared to the one your assigned computer gives you.
